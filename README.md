# First ML Model

This project builds a simple neural network using TensorFlow to learn the relationship:

Y = 3X + 1

The model is trained using 6 data points and predicts values for new inputs.



## Fashion MNIST Computer Vision Model

This project includes a neural network built using TensorFlow to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
